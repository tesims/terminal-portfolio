            \nWelcome to my digital space. My name is Anna, and I passionately explore emerging technologies. With a solid foundation in Data Science Engineering from the University of Michigan, I've navigated roles as diverse as Design Engineer, Trading Analyst, and XR Dev and Lab Manager. My research work spans from analyzing carbon emissions in underdeveloped countries to studying the impact of deep learning in computational finance and exoplanet characterization.
            \nI'm fascinated by machine learning, neuroscience, and manufacturing and design, and I'm actively exploring innovative ways to integrate these interests into a cohesive career path. Throughout 2023, I travelled across the country every two weeks to participate in hackathons. These hackathons were not just competitions; they were my classroom, keeping me abreast of cutting-edge tools, technologies, and opportunities in tech.
            \nMy journey as a startup founder began at Founder University, where I launched a fintech company dedicated to reshaping retirement savings for millennials and Gen Z by facilitating direct investment opportunities in emerging markets. It soared with support from LocalHost, who believed in us enough to provide the initial investment for our SEC licensing.
            \nI've set my sights on upskilling and earning better credentials in 2024, aiming to enhance my credibility and create a solid foundation for turning ambitious plans into successful outcomes. Whether you're a fellow tech enthusiast, potential collaborator, or just passing through, I'm glad you're here. Let's connect and explore how we can make a difference, together.

                <p style="margin: 2px 0;">PII Data Masking is a privacy-preserving solution that utilizes locally (cloud) hosted language models to identify and replace sensitive personal information within datasets. By assessing the context and importance of the redacted data, the system generates non-identifiable alternatives that maintain the semantic integrity and analytical value of the original text. This innovative approach ensures data privacy while preserving the usefulness of the dataset for analysis and insights.</p>
